Hey! thanks for downloading my SVP, I'm sorry in advance since the file is kind of a very big mess, but I hope you can make it work it out lol!
I also included a very HQ instrumental in case you need one, and as for mixing, I recommend using lots of autotune and flanger.

Please don't forget to credit me (Nacho) and send me your cover if you upload it, I would love to see it!! :D
